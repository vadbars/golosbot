# golosbot
Simple chrome extension that upvotes the best contents when you go to golos.io/created/ for you. It helps get as many curation rewards as possible on your favorite social network.

Just install/enable the extension in chrome, go to steemit.com and login on an account. Finally just visit:
```
https://golos.io/created/
notice the ending /
```

It will automatically start scrolling and fetching more content, then analyze everything and eventually upvote. Then it will refresh and do it again, and again, and again, and again.

Right click the extension and go to options to change the settings of the bot.
